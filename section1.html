    <h1>Section 1: Pre-Field Checklist</h1>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>To provide a comprehensive, actionable checklist for both mobilizers and team members to ensure all spiritual, administrative, and logistical preparations are completed effectively before departure.</p>

    <h2>Guide to Using This Checklist</h2>
    <p>Proper preparation is an act of stewardship. This section provides a timeline to guide the mobilization process, which should begin 4-6 months before the trip. The Team Leader should use their checklist to manage the overall process, setting clear deadlines that correspond with this timeline. Regular pre-trip meetings are essential for keeping everyone on track.</p>
