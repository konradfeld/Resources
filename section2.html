    <h1>Section 2: On-the-Ground Orientation: Culture, Safety, and Ministry Method</h1>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>To equip the team with the foundational spiritual mindset, cultural knowledge, safety protocols, and ministry methods needed to be effective and wise on the field from day one.</p>

    <h2>Trainer's Note</h2>
    <p>This is a long but critical session, designed to be conducted within the first 24 hours of arrival. It will take approximately 4-6 hours. Plan for breaks, facilitate ordering a meal to share during the training, and ensure an open, interactive environment where questions are encouraged. Plan to join the group for dinner afterward to continue building rapport and answer further questions.</p>

    <h2>Trainer's Script</h2>
    <p><strong>(Start of Session)</strong></p>
    <p>"Welcome to North Africa. We are so glad you are here. Let's start with a time of gratitude and prayer, centering our hearts on why God has brought us to this place... (Lead in prayer)."</p>
    <p>"My name is [Leader's Name], and I've been serving in this region for [X years]... (Share a brief, 1-2 minute version of your backstory)."</p>
    <p>"Now, I'd love to go around and hear from each of you. Please share your name, a little about who you are, what you're expecting from this trip, and what you do back home."</p>
    <p>"Thank you for sharing. The reason I'm here, and the reason we've asked you to come, is rooted in the deep spiritual need of this region."</p>

        <h3>Module A: The Heart of the Mission (The 'Why')</h3>
        <p>"The area from Mauritania to Libya represents one of the biggest gaps in Christian proclamation in the world. We're talking about over 100 million people from a Muslim background, with the lowest per-capita ratio of followers of Jesus anywhere. Here in Morocco, the number of known believers is only in the hundreds. Most people will live their entire lives in a world saturated by Islam, which we believe is a demonic system of lies, without a single opportunity to hear the Good News."</p>
        <p>"To leave Islam is considered impossible; it's woven into the very fabric of their identity, culture, and family. But God loves them deeply and desires to see them freed from slavery. That's why we are here. The Kingdom of God grows through two simple, powerful acts: prayer and proclamation. Our role is to be ministers of reconciliation, bringing the greatest answer-the Gospel to the greatest need."</p>
        <p>"You might ask, 'Why short-term teams?' The simple answer is: they work. Life here is hard. Relationships are fractured, people are displaced, and work hours are long. Your presence brings fresh energy and focused time for proclamation. STTs are being used by the Father all over the world to bring His Light into dark places. There was a long term worker who move from rural India to Delhi. They were told what was working in rural areas wouldn't work in the city, but they brought in teams for proclamation, and it resulted in thousands of new gatherings and multiple networks of house churches being planted. In Bangladesh, two college students on a short trip shared with a taxi driver. Through that one man, over 50,000 people have come to follow Christ. Never underestimate what God can do through your brief time here."</p>

        <h3>Module B: Practical Cultural Engagement (The 'How')</h3>
        <p>"Alright, let's get into the practical side of being a good guest and a wise witness here. We'll call this 'housekeeping'."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Greetings:</strong> "The standard greeting and response is Salam 3laikum, wa 3laikum assalam, but often it is just shortened to Salam. Men, do not initiate physical contact with women. Follow the woman's lead. If she extends a hand, you may shake it. Women, you'll find that local women are very warm. After a first meeting, it's common to greet with a hug and a light kiss on each cheek. Men, you may do this with other men after you know them better, but a handshake is standard. When you go for the cheek kiss, lean to your left first."</li>
            <li><strong>Home Visits:</strong> "Being invited into a home is a massive honor and a huge opportunity to be able to share the good news with the whole family. Always accept the invitation. It's what we pray for.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shoes:</strong> As you enter, begin taking your shoes off. They may tell you not to worry, but it's a sign of respect. If you enter a room with rugs, definitely offer to take them off again.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gifts:</strong> Always bring a gift. Pastries, fruit (always include bananas!), or drinks like juice or sparkling water are great choices. This also ensures you have something safe to eat and drink.</li>
                    <li><strong>Food Etiquette:</strong> Food is often served in a communal dish, and you'll eat with your hands or bread. Imagine a triangle in the dish in front of you-stay in your zone. Your host will say 'Kul, kul!' which means 'Eat, eat!'. Accept food the first time. After that, you can politely decline by saying it's delicious but you're full. You may have to politely decline multiple times. When you're finished, leave a small amount of food on your plate to show that you've been well-fed and are satisfied."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Food & Water Safety:</strong> "This is non-negotiable. Only drink sealed, bottled water. Avoid raw vegetables or unpeeled fruit unless you're at a very high-end restaurant (120-150dhs/person). If you wash produce yourselves, rinse it, soak it in a vinegar-water solution for 10-15 minutes, and then rinse it again. And a pro-tip: always carry a small packet of tissues or toilet paper with you." (Trainer: Point out nearby places to purchase groceries)</li>
            <li><strong>Money & Tipping:</strong> "In small, local restaurants, leaving 5-10 Dirhams is appropriate. At nicer places, tip about 10%. Always try to give the tip directly to your waiter. When you're in the souk (the market), bartering is expected for anything without a price tag. It's okay to walk away politely. And keep perspective-convert the price to your home currency. Don't let a small amount of money wound your pride."</li>
            <li><strong>Photography:</strong> "Be respectful. Do not take pictures of official buildings, police, or military personnel. General scenes in the market are fine, but never take a photo of an individual without asking their permission first. A good way is to compliment them on something, then ask. If you do take a picture of a person, it's polite to offer a small tip of 5-10 Dirhams."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="module">
        <h3>Module B.5: Getting Around (Transportation)</h3>
        <p>"Alright, let's talk about how you'll be getting around the city. It's very walkable, but you'll also be using taxis, so we need to cover the right way to do that."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Taxis (Petit Taxis):</strong> "These are the smaller, turquoise-colored taxis. They are the most common way to get around. A few key rules:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> They have a max of 3 passengers. Don't be surprised if the driver stops to pick up other people heading in the same direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hailing a Taxi:</strong> First, know where you're going and the general direction. Look for a nearby landmark to tell the driver. Stand on the side of the street where traffic is flowing that way. You can signal with your hand how many seats you need.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Interaction:</strong> When a taxi slows down, first say hello-'Salam' and then state your destination. They might just drive off if they aren't going that way. That's normal. If they accept, get in.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Meter (Magana):</strong> This is critical. As soon as you get in, watch to see if the driver starts the meter. If they don't after a few seconds, you need to ask them to. Just say the word 'Magana.' If they refuse or wave you off, it is perfectly okay to get out and find another taxi. Otherwise, they will invent a high price at the end.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> The minimum fare is 7 Dirhams. Most rides within the city will be under 20 Dirhams. Have small bills or change ready, at least a 50dh or smaller.</li>
                    <li><strong>Etiquette:</strong> Guys should generally sit in the front seat, girls in the back. Don't use the seatbelts-locals don't, and it can be seen as unusual. Also, only use the doors on the right side (curb side) of the car. And avoid the taxis that are sitting parked and waiting; they will almost always overcharge you. Hail a moving taxi instead.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>InDrive App:</strong> "This is an app like Uber. It's in a legal gray area but is used by everyone, including police on their days off. You won't get in trouble for using it.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The 'Friend' Method:</strong> When you use InDrive, always have one person sit in the front passenger seat. This makes it look like you're a friend getting a ride, not a customer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Discreet:</strong> Don't call an InDrive right in front of a group of police or a taxi stand, as it can cause tension with the official taxi drivers. Walk a little way down the street first.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> It's door-to-door, you know the price upfront, and it's great for ministry conversations, especially for the men.</li>
                    <li><strong>For the Ladies:</strong> If you have a great conversation with a male InDrive driver, do not give him your number. Instead, take his number and pass it along to one of the brothers on our team for follow-up."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Buses:</strong> "The bus system is actually quite reliable, and Google Maps shows accurate routes and times. This is a good option if you know your route."</li>
            <li><strong>What Not to Do:</strong> "Do not get dropped off right in front of the AirBnB, use [landmark 3-5 minute walk] and walk the rest of the way. No mopeds. Grand Taxis (Green or Tan) go between cities or travel specific routes. Let us know if you plan to use one on your day off and we can help you."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="module">
        <h3>Module C: Safety and Security Protocols (The 'Wisdom')</h3>
        <p>"This next part is crucial. Our goal is to be bold with the Gospel, but not careless with our security. Carelessness on your part can have long-term consequences for the work God is doing here long after you leave."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Respect & Hot Topics:</strong> "You must show respect. Never disrespect Islam, Mohammed, or the King. Do not engage in political discussions. Topics like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or American politics are highly emotional. If asked, have a simple, compassionate, and neutral response ready. Something like: 'I don't know much about the situation, but it makes me incredibly sad to see so many people suffering. It shows what a broken world we live in.' Then change the subject."</li>
            <li><strong>Public Witness:</strong> "We are not here to be loud and attract attention. A team once made posters and went to a public square; they were escorted to the airport for a one-way flight home that same day. Also do not openly pass out books or tracts. Be wise. If someone is interested in reading we have a QR code they can scan or you can help them download the Bible app and find their language."</li>
            <li><strong>Police Interactions & the "STS Box":</strong> "It's unlikely you'll be stopped, but if you are, your story is simple and truthful. We call this your 'STS'-your Short, Truthful Statement. You need to stay inside the 'STS Box.' Think of it as a safe space of answers.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inside the Box:</strong> You are a tourist. You love the culture, you are discovering the city, you love interacting with local people, you are discussing worldviews. For example: 'I'm a tourist, and I love to meet local people and discuss culture.' This is all true.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outside the Box:</strong> You are a missionary, you are here for evangelism, you are visiting specific workers. Do not use these phrases.</li>
                    <li>If an interaction becomes serious, notify your team leader immediately. Do not contact people back in the US. This can create massive complications, like the time a governor got involved over a lost wallet. Let us handle it."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Digital Security:</strong> "Do not post anything about your trip on social media while you are here or even when you get back. Not a single photo, status, or check-in. We also ask that you refrain from posting about your trip even after you return, as it can jeopardize the safety of workers here. You are welcome to share in small group settings, but please also remind those listening to not post about it on social media. Be mindful of your conversations in public-many people understand English even if they don't appear to speak it. Do not discuss sensitive topics while in public."</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Security:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carry a copy of your passport, not the real thing.</li>
                    <li>Never go anywhere alone. If you need solitude, find a park where you can have space but remain in sight of a teammate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ladies:</strong> You will receive unwanted attention. Most of it is catcalls and is not aggressive. Say 'no' ('la') firmly and keep walking. If you feel you are being followed or harassed, walk into the nearest shop, find an older man or the owner, and point the person out. The community will often step in to help.</li>
                    <li><strong>Home Invites:</strong> If you are invited to a home, notify the team and a worker with a pinned location and the host's name. Girls, do not go to a man's home without a guy from your team. Always say you are traveling with your 'brother' or 'friends'. After you arrive at the home notify your TL and send updates every now and then, especially if it going late."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> "Overcommunicate with your team. Be on time. Use Signal for communication with workers and WhatsApp for locals. Let your leader know if you feel unsure about anything."</li>
            <li><strong>Minors:</strong>"Do not engage minors in spiritual conversations. Morocco is very protective of children, talking to them about spiritual things is a fast way to have to leave the country and can jeapordize the security of long term workers. In general it would be best to not approach minors at all.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="module">
        <h3>Module D: The Ministry "Roadmap" (The 'Work')</h3>
        <p>"Okay, let's talk about the actual process of sharing. We want to be intentional. We are looking for people who God is already drawing to Himself-people who are hungry for truth. It's not our job to convince, but to present the Gospel clearly and lovingly."</p>
        <p>"Here is the path we follow. English Speaker → Evaluate Level → Care through Prayer → 15s Testimony → Gospel Share"</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Find an English Speaker:</strong> "This is the first step. You can simply ask, 'Excuse me, do you speak English?'"</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluate Their Level:</strong> "If they say yes, you need to find out how well. The most loving thing you can do is ensure they can understand the Gospel clearly. If their English isn't strong enough, it's better to end the conversation politely and find someone else. Ask simple questions to get them talking: 'What is a must-see sight here in the city?' or 'Where's the best place to eat?'"</li>
            <li><strong>Care Through Prayer:</strong> "As you talk, listen for a pain point-sickness, loneliness, joblessness. We want to care for them genuinely. Ask questions to understand their circumstances, the feelings about those circumstances, and what they perceive their need is. Then ask a simple question: 'Can I ask God to help you with that right now?' They might be confused, so clarify you mean praying for them right there. Keep the prayer short, simple, and focused. Pray with your eyes open. Pray with expectation that God might show his power. Always pray in the name of Jesus. Afterwards, ask, 'Can I tell you why I pray in the name of Jesus?'"</li>
            <li><strong>Share Your 15-Second Testimony:</strong> "This is the bridge. It's not your whole life story; it's a 'before and after' snapshot. [Draw this on the board: a vertical line for the cross, with a 'T' shape on top. Write 2 adjectives for your life before Christ on the left, and 2 for your life after Christ on the right. Ex: Empty → Purpose] 'Think of one or two words that describe your life before you truly followed Jesus, and one or two words for your life after. My story is that I was [adjective], but then I encountered Jesus, and He changed my life, and now I have [adjective].' Use simple words. Then ask, 'Do you have a story like this?'"</li>
            <li><strong>Share the Gospel (The 3 Circles):</strong> "If the conversation is going well, you can say, 'Jesus changed my life in a very personal way. I'm not talking about religion-religion is man-made rules to try and earn God's favor. The Gospel is the opposite. It's the good news that God loves us so much He paid our debt for us through Jesus.' This is a great time to share the Gospel. We use a simple tool called the 3 Circles. It's easy to draw and helps the listener follow along." [Draw the 3 Circles diagram on the board and walk them through it slowly. Have the team practice drawing it themselves.]</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="module">
        <h3>Module E: Responding to Objections (The 'Answers')</h3>
        <p><strong>Tool 1: Establish the Authority of the Previous Scriptures</strong></p>
        <p>"You can say, 'My friend, you follow the Quran, and the Quran says God's Word cannot be changed. It also says you should believe the books that came before it. Can I show you?'"</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Surah 10:64:</strong> "This verse says, '...there is no change in the Word of Allah.' The logic is simple: if the Bible was the Word of God at one point, and God's Word cannot be changed, then the Bible must still be the Word of God."</li>
            <li><strong>Surah 10:94:</strong> "This tells Mohammed that if he is in doubt, he should 'ask those who read the scripture before you.' This is a direct command to consult the people of the Book-Jews and Christians-who read the Torah and the Injeel (Gospel)."</li>
            <li><strong>Surah 5:68:</strong> "This one is very direct. It says, 'You have nothing to stand on if you do not believe in and observe the Torah, Zubor, Injeel.' You can use this to say, 'According to your own book, you should believe and follow the Gospel. Can I show you a story from it?' This is a great bridge to sharing from Mark 2 or Luke 7."</li>
            <li>"If they respond, 'But it's been changed since then!', you can draw a simple timeline. The Quran was written around 630 AD. The manuscripts we have for the Bible are from hundreds of years before that. So, the Bible they are commanded to believe in is the same one we have today."</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Tool 2: The Meaning of 'Injeel'</strong></p>
        <p>"You can ask them, 'According to your faith, there are four holy books: the Torah, the Zabur, the Injeel, and the Quran. Do you know what the names mean?' The first three mean 'the Law,' 'the Psalms,' and 'the Recitation.' But 'Injeel' means 'Good News.' You can say, 'God gave you a book called the Good News because he loves you and wants you to receive good news on the day of judgment, not bad news. I would encourage you to read the book God named Good News.'"</p>
        <p><strong>Tool 3: The Uniqueness of Jesus</strong></p>
        <p>"If they say Mohammed will intercede for them, you can elevate God's holiness and Jesus's uniqueness. The Quran says Mohammed doesn't know what will happen to him when he dies. But in the Injeel, Jesus says, 'I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.' You can then ask, 'Who are you going to follow on the day of judgment? The one who doesn't know his own fate, or the one who claims to be the only Way?'"</p>
